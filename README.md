# About
It's a simple JavaScript game where you play against the computer. It's a practice project I made for CodeCademy curriculum.

# Tech stack
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Features
It generates a random number, let's user to make a bet, generates a bet for a computer, then compares all the three numbers and establishes a winner. It keeps the score over several rounds. It also shows a popup when the user tries to enter a number that lies outside the allowed range (0-9).

# What I learned
Event listeners, writing simple JavaScript functions, using `<modal>` element.
